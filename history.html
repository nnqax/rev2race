                <p>Formula 1 (F1) was officially established in <b>1950</b> as the highest level of single-seater motorsport. The first-ever World Championship race took place at <b>Silverstone, UK</b>, on <b>May 13, 1950</b>, and was won by <b>Giuseppe Farina</b> driving an <b>Alfa Romeo 158</b> .driving an Alfa Romeo 158. Farina went on to win the first championship, but it was <b> Juan Manuel Fangio</b> who dominated the decade, winning <b>five titles</b>. Cars in this era were front-engined, with little regard for aerodynamics or driver safety. Drivers raced without seatbelts, and fatal crashes were tragically common. </p>

                <p>The <b>1960s</b> saw major technical advancements, including the introduction of <b>rear-engine cars</b>, which made them faster and more agile. British teams like <b>Lotus, McLaren, and Brabham</b> started challenging Italian dominance. <b>Lotus</b>, led by <b>Colin Chapman</b>, introduced the <b>monocoque chassis</b>, making cars lighter and more rigid. This decade also saw the first real experiments with <b>aerodynamic</b>s, as teams began adding wings to generate downforce for better grip. However, safety remained a major issue, with many drivers losing their lives due to the dangerous nature of the sport. </p>

                <p>The <b>1970s</b> marked the commercialization of Formula 1. Sponsorship deals became a crucial part of team funding, leading to cars covered in corporate logos. Aerodynamics took a massive leap forward with the introduction of <b>ground effect technology</b>, pioneered by Lotus. This allowed cars to generate extreme downforce, making them much faster in corners. However, safety concerns grew, with high-speed crashes becoming even more dangerous. Deaths of drivers like <b>Jochen Rindt, Ronnie Peterson, Niki Lauda and James Hunt</b> became legends. </p>
